# Awesome Startup Project:
- This project is about requesting random employees' data from a public API
- It is done by: **Khaled Alqenaei**, and I am looking forward to getting an **"Exceeds Expectation"** evaluation.

# To run this project:
1- Clone the project

2- Double-click on `index.html` to run it on your preferred web browser.

3- Click on any employee to see their details.

4- Use `next` and `previous` buttons to navigate between the employees.
Please note that when you reach the first employee and click `previous`, you will navigate to the last employee.
Also, when you reach the last employee and click `next`, you will navigate to the first employee.

5- Close the modal by clicking on `X`.

6- Use the search input field and submit the form by clicking `Enter` or the search button.
Please note that when you enter `ill`, both `William` and `Bill` will be matched.

# Customization:
I used a font from `Google Fonts` named `Mochiy Pop One`.
